# Setting Up Kubernetes Control Plane with kubeadm and Containerd

This guide provides a step-by-step procedure to set up a **Kubernetes Control Plane** using `kubeadm` and `containerd`, along with **Calico** as the Container Network Interface (CNI). This is intended for users installing Kubernetes on a master node.

---

## Step 1: Initialize the Kubernetes Control Plane

Run the following command **only on the master node** to initialize the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
sudo kubeadm init
```

### Best Option for kubeadm init:
```bash
sudo kubeadm init \
  --pod-network-cidr=172.16.0.0/16 \
  --control-plane-endpoint=192.168.1.181 \
  --cri-socket=unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

### Explanation:
- `kubeadm init`: Initializes the Kubernetes cluster.
- `--pod-network-cidr=172.16.0.0/16`: Specifies the pod network range required for the CNI plugin (Calico in this case).
- If cidr is not given explicitly, Calico’s default (172.16.0.0/16) will be implemented.

---

## Industry Standards:
- The pod network CIDR (--pod-network-cidr) must not overlap with the node network or any other networks your cluster interacts with (e.g., your LAN, VPNs, or external services).
- Kubernetes doesn’t enforce a specific pod CIDR, but common practices favor private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) that are large enough for scalability and distinct from physical networks.
- Calico’s default (172.16.0.0/16) is widely used because it’s a safe, non-conflicting range for many setups.
- 10.0.0.0/8 or Subnets (e.g., 10.244.0.0/16): Preferred in enterprise environments (e.g., GKE, EKS) for scalability and minimal overlap.
- Provides enough IPs (e.g., /16 = 65,536 IPs is ample for most small clusters).

After the initialization, Kubernetes will provide a `kubeadm join` command. **Save this command** as it will be needed to add worker nodes later.

---

## Step 2: Configure kubectl for the Master Node

To use `kubectl` commands on the master node, set up the configuration:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

### Explanation:
- The `admin.conf` file contains authentication credentials for accessing the cluster.
- This step ensures the `kubectl` command can communicate with the cluster.

Also, set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable for persistent access:

```bash
echo "export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To verify the configuration:

```bash
echo $KUBECONFIG
```

---

## Step 3: Install Container Networking (Calico)

**Calico** is a highly scalable CNI that provides networking and network policy features for Kubernetes.

1. **Apply Calico Manifest**
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.1/manifests/calico.yaml
```

2. **Verify Cluster**
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```


### Explanation:
- **Calico** is installed as a Kubernetes manifest file.
- `kubectl apply -f calico.yaml` deploys the Calico network components.

After installation, verify the networking setup:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

---

## Step 4: Verify the Control Plane Components

Ensure that the Kubernetes control plane components are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

Look for these critical components:
- `kube-apiserver` - Handles API requests.
- `kube-controller-manager` - Maintains cluster state.
- `kube-scheduler` - Assigns workloads to nodes.
- `etcd` - Key-value store for Kubernetes data.

All components should be in the `Running` state.

---

## Step 5: Check Node Status

To verify that the master node is ready, run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

If the node status shows `NotReady`, wait for a few minutes and recheck.

---

## Step 6: Restart Kubernetes Services (If Necessary)

If any components are not running, restart services:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
sudo systemctl restart containerd
```

Additionally, check permissions for `admin.conf` if access issues occur:

```bash
ls -l /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

---

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up a **Kubernetes Control Plane** with `kubeadm` and `containerd`, using **Calico** as the CNI. The cluster should be ready for deploying workloads.

To add worker nodes, use the `kubeadm join` command provided during initialization.

### Next Steps:
- Deploy applications using Kubernetes.
- Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for security.
- Configure persistent storage solutions.

For troubleshooting, check logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system <pod-name>
```

Happy Kubernetes deployment! 🚀
