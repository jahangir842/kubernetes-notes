### 1. **Generate Join Token on the Master Node**

On the **master node**, execute the following command to generate a token and print the join command:

```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

This will output a command that includes the token and CA certificate hash required for worker nodes to join the cluster.

---

### 2. **Verify Time on Worker Node:**

Ensure all nodes have synchronized clock with the master node.

```bash
date
```

---

### 2. **Join Worker Nodes to the Cluster**

On each **worker node**, run the join command generated in the previous step. Replace `<token>` and `<hash>` with the actual values from the master node's output:

```bash
sudo kubeadm join 192.168.1.181:6443 \
  --token <token> \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash> \
  --cri-socket=unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

This command registers the worker node with the Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 3. **Verify Cluster Status**

On the **master node**, verify that the worker nodes have successfully joined the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Additionally, check the status of the system pods to ensure all components are running correctly:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
```

---

### 4. **Test the Cluster Functionality**

To test the cluster, deploy a sample application (e.g., Nginx) and expose it as a service:

1. **Create a Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=3
   ```

2. **Expose the Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
   ```

3. **Verify the Deployment and Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods,svc -o wide
   ```

This will confirm that the deployment and service are functioning as expected.
