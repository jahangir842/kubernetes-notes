## Roots of Kubernetes
The Kubernetes project was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). For more details, visit the official Kubernetes website: [https://kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)

The evolution of Kubernetes started from **Borg**, Google's very own distributed workload manager. Borg was designed to manage and schedule large-scale workloads across Google's vast infrastructure. It provided the foundation and inspiration for Kubernetes, incorporating many of the same principles and concepts. For more information on Borg, you can refer to the [Borg, Omega, and Kubernetes paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/).

**Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** currently hosts the Kubernetes project, along with other popular cloud native projects, such as Argo, Cilium, Prometheus, Fluentd, etcd, CoreDNS, cri-o, containerd, Helm, Envoy, Istio, and Linkerd, just to name a few.

### What Is Kubernetes?

According to the Kubernetes website,

`Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications`

Kubernetes comes from the Greek word κυβερνήτης, which means **helmsman** or **ship pilot**. With this analogy in mind, we can think of Kubernetes as the pilot on a ship of containers.

Kubernetes is also referred to as **k8s** (pronounced Kate's), as there are 8 characters between k and s.

Kubernetes is highly inspired by the **Google Borg** system, a container and workload orchestrator for its global operations, Google has been using for more than a decade. It is an open source project written in the **Go** language and licensed under the License, Version 2.0.

Kubernetes was started by Google and, with its v1.0 release in July 2015, Google **donated** it to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), one of the largest **sub-foundations** of the **Linux Foundation**.

New Kubernetes versions are released in 4 month cycles. The current stable version is 1.32 (as of February 2025). https://kubernetes.io/releases/

### Kubernetes Features

Kubernetes provides a comprehensive set of features for container orchestration, including:

- **Automatic Bin Packing**: Automatically schedules containers based on resource needs and constraints, maximizing resource utilization without compromising availability.

- **Extensibility**: Allows extending a Kubernetes cluster with custom features without altering the core code.

- **Self-Healing**: Detects and replaces failed containers, reschedules them from failed nodes, and restarts unresponsive containers according to health checks and policies. Prevents routing traffic to unhealthy containers.

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Offers manual or automatic scaling of applications based on CPU usage or custom metrics.

- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Assigns IP addresses to containers and provides a DNS name for a set of containers to facilitate load balancing across them.

#### Additional Features

- **Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks**: Seamlessly handles application updates and configuration changes, monitoring the application’s health to avoid downtime.

- **Secret & Configuration Management**: Manages sensitive information (like credentials) separately from container images, ensuring secure handling without embedding secrets in code repositories.

- **Storage Orchestration**: Automates the mounting of storage solutions, including local, cloud, distributed, and network storage, to containers.

- **Batch Execution**: Supports batch processing, long-running jobs, and automatic replacement of failed containers.

- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack**: Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing for network communication.

Kubernetes also integrates common Platform as a Service (PaaS) features such as deployment, scaling, and load balancing, with flexible options for adding monitoring, logging, and alerting via plugins.

Additionally, many Kubernetes features evolve through alpha or beta phases, such as stable support for **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** since version 1.8 and **cronjobs** since version 1.21. These features bring even more value as they mature in stability.

---

#### Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Portability**: Kubernetes can be deployed in various environments, including local or remote VMs, bare metal, and public/private/hybrid/multi-cloud setups.

- **Extensibility**: Kubernetes supports integration with 3rd-party open-source tools and has a modular, pluggable architecture. It can orchestrate microservices-based applications and extend functionality through custom resources, operators, APIs, scheduling rules, or plugins.

- **Thriving Community**: Kubernetes has a large and active community, with over 3,500 contributors and 120,000+ commits. It is supported by Special Interest Groups (SIGs) focusing on different topics like scaling, networking, and storage.

## Container Orchestrators

Most container orchestrators can be deployed on the infrastructure of our choice - on bare metal, Virtual Machines, on-premises, on public and hybrid clouds. Kubernetes, for example, can be deployed on a workstation, with or without an isolation layer such as a local hypervisor or container runtime, inside a company's data center, in the cloud on AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Google Compute Engine (GCE) VMs, DigitalOcean Droplets, IBM Virtual Servers, OpenStack, etc.

In addition, there are turnkey cloud solutions which allow production Kubernetes clusters to be installed, with only a few commands, on top of cloud Infrastructures-as-a-Service. These solutions paved the way for the managed container orchestration as-a-Service, more specifically the managed Kubernetes as-a-Service (KaaS) solution, offered and hosted by the major cloud providers. Examples of KaaS solutions are Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), DigitalOcean Kubernetes, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

## Control Plane Node

- **Function**: The control plane node is the central management component of a Kubernetes cluster, overseeing its operational state.
  
- **Communication**: Users interact with the control plane using:
  - Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - Web User Interface (Web UI)
  - Application Programming Interface (API)

- **Importance**: Maintaining a functional control plane is critical to avoid downtime and service disruption, which can lead to business losses.

- **High Availability (HA)**: 
  - Control plane replicas can be added for fault tolerance.
  - Only one node actively manages the cluster, but all nodes remain in sync.

- **State Persistence**: Cluster configuration data is stored in a distributed key-value store, which is separate from client workload data.

- **Key-Value Store Configurations**:
  - **Stacked Topology**: The key-value store is hosted on the control plane node, benefiting from HA of control plane replicas.
  - **External Topology**: The key-value store is hosted separately, requiring its own HA setup, which increases operational costs.

A control plane node hosts several essential components and agents, including the 

- API server
- scheduler
- controller managers
- key-value data store.

Additionally, it runs:
- Container runtime
- Node agent (kubelet)
- Proxy (kube-proxy)
- Optional observability add-ons, such as:
  - Dashboard
  - Cluster-level monitoring
  - Logging tools

### API Server:

The **kube-apiserver** is a central control plane component responsible for coordinating all administrative tasks within a Kubernetes cluster. Here’s a concise overview of its functions:

- **Request Handling:** The API Server intercepts RESTful calls from users, administrators, developers, operators, and external agents, validating and processing these requests.

- **State Management:** It reads the current state of the Kubernetes cluster from a key-value store. After executing a call, the resulting state is saved back to the key-value store for persistence.

- **Single Point of Interaction:** The API Server is the only control plane component that interacts directly with the key-value store, serving as the intermediary for other control plane agents querying the cluster's state.

- **Configurability:** It is highly configurable and can be customized to suit specific needs.

- **Scalability:** The API Server can scale horizontally and supports the addition of custom secondary API Servers. In this setup, the primary API Server acts as a proxy, routing incoming RESTful calls to the appropriate secondary API Servers based on custom-defined rules.

### Scheduler:

The **kube-scheduler** assigns new workloads, such as pods, to nodes based on the Kubernetes cluster's state and workload requirements. Key functions include:

- **Workload Assignment:** Assigns pods to worker nodes by evaluating resource usage and workload constraints.
  
- **Decision Factors:** Considers Quality of Service (QoS), data locality, affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints, tolerations, and cluster topology.

- **Scheduling Algorithm:** Filters potential node candidates and scores them to determine the best fit for the workload.

- **Communication:** Reports decisions back to the API Server for deployment coordination.

- **Configurability:** Highly configurable through scheduling policies and supports custom schedulers.

- **Complexity:** More complex in multi-node clusters; simpler in single-node setups for learning and development.

### Controller Managers:

**Controller managers** are key components of the control plane that ensure the Kubernetes cluster maintains its desired state. Here’s how they function:

- **Watch-Loop Process:** Continuously compares the desired state (from configuration data) with the current state (from the key-value store via the API Server).

- **Corrective Actions:** Takes action to rectify any discrepancies between the desired and current states.

- **Kube-Controller-Manager:** 
  - Manages node availability.
  - Maintains expected pod counts.
  - Creates endpoints, service accounts, and API access tokens.

- **Cloud-Controller-Manager:**
  - Interacts with cloud provider infrastructure.
  - Manages storage volumes provided by cloud services.
  - Oversees load balancing and routing.

Together, these managers ensure the Kubernetes cluster operates effectively and meets defined configurations.

### Key-Value Data Store (etcd)

**etcd** is an open-source, distributed key-value data store under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), essential for persisting the state of a Kubernetes cluster. Here are the key points about etcd:

- **Data Management:**
  - Data is appended, never replaced, and obsolete data is periodically compacted to reduce size.
  - Only the API Server communicates with the etcd data store.

- **Management Tool:** 
  - The CLI tool **etcdctl** offers snapshot save and restore capabilities, useful for single-instance clusters in development.

- **High Availability (HA):**
  - In production environments, etcd should be replicated in HA mode for data resiliency.
  - Supports both **stacked** (running on the same control plane node) and **external** topologies (isolated on a separate host).

- **Raft Consensus Algorithm:** 
  - Ensures that a group of machines can function cohesively and tolerate node failures, including leader node failures.
  - One node acts as the leader while others are followers; leader elections are handled gracefully.

- **Usage:** 
  - Besides cluster state, etcd stores configuration details like subnets, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

By utilizing etcd, Kubernetes ensures a reliable and consistent state management system for the cluster.

### Worker Nodes:

- **Running Environment:** Worker nodes provide the environment for running client applications, which are packaged as containers inside **Pods**.
  
- **Pods:** The smallest scheduling unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers. Pods are managed by control plane agents and scheduled on worker nodes.

- **Resource Management:** Worker nodes offer compute, memory, storage, and networking resources for Pods to run and communicate.

- **Network Traffic:** In multi-worker clusters, network traffic between users and containerized applications is handled directly by worker nodes, bypassing the control plane node.

Worker nodes are essential for executing and maintaining application workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Worker Node Components

A Kubernetes worker node hosts the components that allow it to run and manage Pods, which contain your application containers. These components includes:

- Container runtime
- Node agent (kubelet)
- CRI shims
- Network proxy (kube-proxy)
- Add-ons to extend functionality

Here’s a detailed breakdown of each component:

#### 1. **Container Runtime**

Kubernetes is a container orchestration engine but cannot manage or run containers directly. To handle container lifecycle management, each node in a Kubernetes cluster (both control plane and worker nodes) needs a container runtime. The container runtime is responsible for pulling container images, starting, stopping, and managing containers on the node. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes through the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**.

**Note** The recommendation is to run the Kubernetes control plane components as containers, hence the necessity of a runtime on the control plane nodes. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes:

- **CRI-O:** A lightweight container runtime specifically designed for Kubernetes. It supports image registries like quay.io and Docker Hub, providing a minimal and efficient solution for running Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compatible containers.
  
- **containerd:** This is a simple, powerful, and portable container runtime. Originally a lower-level component of Docker, it has now become an independent runtime that directly integrates with Kubernetes via the CRI.

- **Docker Engine:** Once the most popular runtime for Kubernetes, Docker uses containerd under the hood to manage containers. However, the direct integration of Docker with Kubernetes via the dockershim has been deprecated in Kubernetes v1.24.

- **Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR):** Previously known as Docker Enterprise Edition, MCR is a commercial container platform that also integrates with Kubernetes via the new cri-dockerd adapter, ensuring Docker Engine compatibility even after dockershim's removal.

Each node in the Kubernetes cluster must have a container runtime installed, and for the control plane nodes, the control plane components themselves typically run as containers.

#### 2. **Node Agent - Kubelet**

The **kubelet** is a critical agent that runs on every node in the Kubernetes cluster, including both control plane and worker nodes. Its primary responsibility is to communicate with the control plane components, particularly the API Server, and ensure that the containers specified in Pod definitions are running correctly on the node. The kubelet does this by:

- **Receiving Pod definitions:** The kubelet receives Pod specifications from the API Server, which is part of the control plane, and ensures that the containers specified in those Pods are running as expected on the node.
  
- **Monitoring the health of containers:** The kubelet continuously monitors the state of the containers running on its node. If a container crashes or becomes unhealthy, the kubelet can restart it based on the configuration.

- **Interfacing with the container runtime:** The kubelet works with the container runtime to handle operations such as pulling container images, creating containers, and managing their lifecycle.

The kubelet does not manage containers directly; instead, it relies on the container runtime (such as containerd or CRI-O) through the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**.

#### 3. **Kubelet - CRI Shims**

The kubelet communicates with the container runtime through the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**, which abstracts the differences between various container runtimes, allowing Kubernetes to work with any runtime that implements the CRI. The kubelet does this by using **CRI shims**, which are implementations or adapters that allow the kubelet to interface with specific container runtimes. Examples include:

- **cri-containerd:** A CRI shim that integrates directly with containerd, allowing kubelet to manage containers using containerd without requiring direct interaction with the runtime.
  
- **CRI-O:** This CRI shim enables kubelet to use any OCI-compliant runtime, such as runC. It’s particularly lightweight and optimized for Kubernetes use cases.

- **cri-dockerd:** After the deprecation of dockershim in Kubernetes v1.24, the cri-dockerd shim was introduced by Docker Inc. and Mirantis to maintain support for the Docker Engine. This shim ensures that Docker can still be used as a container runtime in Kubernetes clusters by adhering to the CRI standard.

The introduction of CRI allowed Kubernetes to decouple the kubelet from specific runtimes like Docker, providing more flexibility and standardization.

#### 4. **Proxy - Kube-proxy**

The **kube-proxy** is a network component that runs on every node, including both control plane and worker nodes. Its role is to manage network traffic to and from Pods, ensuring that services running in the cluster are accessible to internal and external clients. Kube-proxy handles:

- **Service discovery and load balancing:** Kube-proxy routes traffic between services in the cluster by maintaining network rules and forwarding traffic to the appropriate Pods. It ensures that requests are forwarded to healthy Pods based on user-defined Services.

- **Network rule management:** Kube-proxy dynamically updates the networking rules on the node to reflect the current state of the cluster. It can manage rules for forwarding TCP, UDP, and SCTP traffic.

- **Integration with iptables:** On Linux nodes, kube-proxy works closely with **iptables**, a built-in firewall utility that manages packet filtering and NAT (Network Address Translation) rules. Kube-proxy uses iptables to implement forwarding and load-balancing rules across multiple Pods.

Kube-proxy abstracts the underlying network details, making it easier to manage communication between Pods and the external world.

#### 5. **Add-ons**

Add-ons provide additional features and functionalities that are not part of the core Kubernetes platform but are essential for many production environments. These components are usually implemented through third-party plugins or services and include:

- **DNS:** A core add-on that provides DNS records for Kubernetes resources such as services and Pods. This allows applications within the cluster to communicate with each other using friendly DNS names instead of IP addresses.

- **Dashboard:** A web-based user interface that allows administrators to manage and monitor their Kubernetes clusters visually. The dashboard offers functionality like managing workloads, viewing logs, and monitoring cluster health.

- **Monitoring:** Cluster-level monitoring solutions collect metrics from nodes, containers, and Pods, providing insights into performance, resource usage, and potential issues. Prometheus is a popular monitoring tool used in Kubernetes clusters.

- **Logging:** A centralized logging solution aggregates logs from containers running across all nodes in the cluster. This is critical for troubleshooting, auditing, and monitoring application behavior. Popular tools include Elasticsearch and Fluentd.

- **Device Plugins:** Device plugins allow nodes to advertise hardware resources (such as GPUs, FPGAs, or specialized NICs) to the cluster. Pods can request and utilize these resources for performance-intensive applications, such as machine learning and data processing.

These add-ons extend Kubernetes' capabilities and help meet the operational needs of complex and scalable applications.

These worker node components work together to ensure that Kubernetes can effectively schedule, run, and manage containerized workloads while providing the necessary networking, resource management, and observability for applications.

### Networking Challenges in Kubernetes

In microservices-based applications, networking is critical to achieving the same level of interaction that was once inherent in monolithic architectures. Microservices rely heavily on efficient networking to maintain communication between loosely coupled components. Kubernetes, as a containerized microservices orchestrator, must address a series of unique networking challenges:

1. **Container-to-Container communication within Pods**
2. **Pod-to-Pod communication on the same node and across different nodes in the cluster**
3. **Service-to-Pod communication within and across namespaces in the cluster**
4. **External-to-Service communication for client access to applications running in the cluster**

Each of these networking challenges must be effectively managed by a Kubernetes cluster and its associated networking plugins.

## Networking Challenges Breakdown

#### 1. **Container-to-Container Communication Inside Pods**

Kubernetes utilizes the container runtime to create isolated network spaces, often referred to as **network namespaces** in Linux. These namespaces allow for isolation between containers, enabling them to have their own virtualized network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables.

In Kubernetes, containers within the same Pod must be able to communicate seamlessly. To achieve this, Kubernetes uses a special infrastructure container, often called the **Pause container**. The Pause container is initialized when a Pod starts, and it creates a network namespace that all containers in the Pod share. This ensures that containers within the same Pod can communicate using **localhost** as if they were running on the same physical machine, without needing explicit networking configurations.

This approach simplifies intra-Pod communication, as all containers share the same IP address and port space, making it easy for applications running in the same Pod to interact directly.

#### 2. **Pod-to-Pod Communication Across Nodes**

In a Kubernetes cluster, Pods are distributed across multiple nodes in a dynamic and often unpredictable manner. However, Pods must still be able to communicate with each other, regardless of where they are scheduled. To ensure seamless communication, Kubernetes implements an **IP-per-Pod** networking model, where each Pod is assigned a unique IP address, just like a virtual machine in a traditional network.

This unique IP allows Pods to communicate directly with one another without the need for **Network Address Translation (NAT)**. Kubernetes expects that every Pod can talk to any other Pod in the cluster, regardless of their physical location on different nodes. This model simplifies communication and ensures that developers don't have to deal with complex network routing.

However, while containers inside a Pod can communicate via localhost, Pods across nodes rely on the **Container Network Interface (CNI)**, which uses various **CNI plugins** to assign IP addresses and configure networking. CNI abstracts away the complexities of container networking by enabling third-party **Software Defined Networking (SDN)** solutions such as **Flannel, Weave, Calico, and Cilium** to integrate with Kubernetes and provide advanced networking features, including **Network Policies**.

These SDN solutions not only provide the basic Pod-to-Pod communication but can also enforce fine-grained network security policies and other advanced functionalities within the cluster.

#### 3. **Service-to-Pod Communication**

Kubernetes introduces the concept of **Services** to manage how Pods communicate both within the same namespace and across different namespaces in a cluster. A Service is a logical abstraction that defines a policy for accessing a group of Pods, typically through a stable virtual IP address and a set of rules that allow requests to be forwarded to the appropriate Pods.

The primary function of a Service is to provide **load balancing** and **service discovery**. When a client or another Pod makes a request to a Service, Kubernetes ensures that the request is routed to one of the Pods associated with the Service, even if the Pods themselves might be running on different nodes. This abstraction helps to decouple the client from the specifics of the individual Pods, providing resilience and scalability.

Within the same namespace or across namespaces, Kubernetes ensures that Pods can interact with Services via the internal DNS provided by the cluster. As Pods are ephemeral and may be recreated with different IP addresses, the Service's stable virtual IP makes it easier to route traffic consistently.

#### 4. **External-to-Service Communication**

Once a containerized application is deployed inside a Kubernetes cluster, it often needs to be accessible by users or external systems outside of the cluster. Kubernetes handles **external accessibility** through Services, specifically through types like **NodePort**, **LoadBalancer**, or **Ingress**.

Kubernetes uses **kube-proxy**, a network proxy running on each node, to manage the routing of external traffic to the appropriate Services. kube-proxy creates and maintains a set of network rules, typically stored in **iptables** on the nodes, which handle the forwarding of traffic to the correct Pods.

When a Service is exposed to the external world, it is assigned a **virtual IP address** and a **dedicated port number**. kube-proxy uses this virtual IP and port to forward traffic from external clients to the Pods behind the Service, ensuring that applications are accessible from outside the cluster.

Additionally, Kubernetes supports advanced configurations like **Ingress controllers**, which provide fine-grained control over external traffic, including SSL termination and routing based on HTTP hostnames and paths.

### Container Network Interface (CNI) Core Plugins

Kubernetes relies on the **Container Network Interface (CNI)** to manage the networking for Pods. CNI plugins are responsible for assigning IP addresses to Pods, setting up network routing, and enforcing any network policies. The container runtime offloads the responsibility of IP assignment to CNI, which uses a selected plugin (like **Bridge** or **MACvlan**) to provide an IP address and configure networking.

These plugins play a critical role in ensuring that Pods can communicate both within the node and across the cluster, adhering to Kubernetes' networking model. While Kubernetes provides some built-in networking options, many production environments prefer third-party CNI plugins due to their additional features, scalability, and support for custom network policies.
