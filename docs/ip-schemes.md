Here are detailed general notes about Kubernetes networking, including Nodes, Pods, Services, and IP schemes.

# **Kubernetes Networking: Nodes, Pods, and Services**

## **1️⃣ Kubernetes Node IPs**
- Each Kubernetes node (both master and worker) has an **Internal IP** assigned by the host OS (e.g., `192.168.1.181`).
- Nodes communicate with each other over this internal network.
- The node's IP is usually assigned from the local network (LAN).

### **Example (`kubectl get nodes -o wide`)**
```
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE
master-node    Ready    control-plane   192.168.1.181   <none>        AlmaLinux 9.5
worker-node1   Ready    <none>          192.168.1.182   <none>        AlmaLinux 9.5
worker-node2   Ready    <none>          192.168.1.183   <none>        AlmaLinux 9.5
```

## **2️⃣ Kubernetes Pod IPs**
- Each Pod is assigned an **IP address** from an internal subnet managed by the Kubernetes CNI (Container Network Interface), such as **Calico, Flannel, or Cilium**.
- Pods running on different worker nodes can communicate with each other using this IP.
- Pod IPs are ephemeral; they change when the Pod is restarted.

### **Example (`kubectl get pods -o wide`)**
```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    IP               NODE
nginx-deployment-7b44dc87c5-5hrgb   1/1     Running   172.16.180.193   worker-node1
nginx-deployment-7b44dc87c5-7nm9s   1/1     Running   172.16.180.194   worker-node1
nginx-deployment-7b44dc87c5-jtq5r   1/1     Running   172.16.203.129   worker-node2
```
### **Observations:**
- The Pods running on `worker-node1` have IPs in the `172.16.180.x` range.
- The Pod running on `worker-node2` has an IP in the `172.16.203.x` range.
- This indicates the cluster is using an **overlay network** (e.g., Calico or Flannel) for inter-Pod communication.

## **3️⃣ Kubernetes Service IPs**
Kubernetes uses **Services** to expose applications running inside Pods.  

### **Types of Services**
1. **ClusterIP (Default)** – Internal communication within the cluster.
2. **NodePort** – Exposes the service on a static port across all nodes.
3. **LoadBalancer** – Uses an external load balancer (mainly in cloud environments).
4. **ExternalName** – Maps a service to an external domain name.

### **Example (`kubectl get svc nginx-nodeport -n nginx-demo`)**
```
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-nodeport   NodePort   10.101.63.221   <none>        80:30007/TCP   11m
```

### **Breakdown:**
- **Service Name:** `nginx-nodeport`
- **Type:** `NodePort`
- **ClusterIP:** `10.101.63.221` (Only accessible within the cluster)
- **NodePort Mapping:**  
  - Port `80` (inside the cluster) is mapped to port `30007` (on each node).
  - Any external request to `http://<NodeIP>:30007` will be forwarded to a Pod.

## **4️⃣ IP Address Comparison Table**
| **Type**      | **Example IP**       | **Assigned By** | **Scope**          | **Usage** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Node IP**  | `192.168.1.181`       | Host OS        | Internal (LAN)    | Used for communication between nodes |
| **Pod IP**   | `172.16.180.193`      | Kubernetes CNI | Internal (Cluster) | Used for Pod-to-Pod communication |
| **Cluster IP** | `10.101.63.221`     | Kubernetes     | Internal (Cluster) | Used for Service-based communication |
| **NodePort**  | `192.168.1.182:30007` | Kubernetes    | External Access   | Used to expose a service outside the cluster |

## **5️⃣ How Network Traffic Flows**
### **1. Internal Pod-to-Pod Communication**
- Pods can communicate **directly** using their assigned IPs.
- Example:
  ```
  curl http://172.16.180.193:80
  ```

### **2. Service-Based Communication**
- A Pod can communicate with another Pod via a **Service** using the **Cluster IP**.
- Example:
  ```
  curl http://10.101.63.221
  ```
- Kubernetes load-balances requests across all matching Pods.

### **3. External Access via NodePort**
- Users can access the service externally via:
  ```
  http://192.168.1.182:30007
  ```
- Kubernetes routes this request to the appropriate Pod.

## **6️⃣ Key Takeaways**
1. **Nodes have LAN IPs** (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
2. **Pods have CNI-managed IPs** (e.g., `172.16.x.x`).
3. **Services get a Cluster IP** (e.g., `10.x.x.x`).
4. **NodePort exposes services externally** via `<NodeIP>:<Port>`.
5. **Kubernetes manages routing** so Pods can communicate across worker nodes.
